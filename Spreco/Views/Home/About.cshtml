    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>
        Spreco was made in order to give Spotify users the ability to easily discover new music at anytime.
        <br />
        Our recommendations are based on your last 20 recently played tracks.
    </p>
    <h1>Website notes</h1>
    <p>
        Once you login you will find our recommendations and the song that those recommendations were inspired by.
        <br />
        When you go to export the top songs into a playlist, we will pick the top three recommended songs for each recently played track so
        that you won't get a playlist of 400 songs.
        <br />
        A top song is one that is at the top of a column of recommeded songs.
        <br />
        If you see a song that is interesting and want to listen right away, just click on the song and it will open in the Spotify Web Player.
